# Stage 1.1: Supervised, Regression Methods
## Linear Regression
Implement Linear Regression on a family of functions determined by the user on a variety of loss functions.

### TODO:
- Implement Predictive Densities (Gaussian)


# Stage 1.2: Supervised, Classification Methods
## K-Nearest-Neighbors
K-Nearest-Neighbors is a classification algorithm that classifies known data using distance.


## Logistic Regression
Implement Logistic Regression for classification


# Stage 1.3: Unsupervised, Classification Methods
## K-Means
K-Means is a classification algorithm that classifies a data point by the nearest distance to the nearest mean.


# Stage 1.4: Probabilistic, Classification Methods
## Bayes Classifier
The Bayes Classifier uses the Bayes' Theorem to predict the class of an instance

# Stage 2.1: Data Processing
## Normalization
Normalization is a method used to avoid the exploding/vanishing gradient problem.

## Encoding
Encoding converts data into a numerical form that can be understood by models.

## Embedding
Embedding converts data into a form that can be input into a model.

## Skip-Gram
Skip-Gram captures the relationships between word contexts and meanings

# Stage 3.1: Deep Learning
## Neural Networks (NNs)
A Neural Network is an iterative algorithm that learns non-linear data.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extract features and train off features to do classification and forecasting tasks.

## Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a network architecture that generates new data that is similar to existing data.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs have an internal memory (state) that can process sequences of inputs, which are used to recognize patterns and predictive tasks

## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
These units can remember and recall information for long periods of time, commonly used in RNNs

## Transformer
Transformers use the self-attention mechanism for state-of-the-art models for tasks such as translation, summarization, and utilisations in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
